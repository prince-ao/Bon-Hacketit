## Description:

Users of our application can take control of their diets in a way that might also save them money. increase their nutritional intake, 
and better plan their day around meals...all without needing to learn additional skills in the kitchen. 

We decided to build this project because we felt that meal planning and recipe construction represent vital opportunities to implement machine 
learning in a way that enriches our daily lives by allowing us to reclaim precious time we would otherwise spend making meal planning decisions. 

Everyone needs to eat, and this need presents choices. Would you rather save time on dishes or save money eating in? When you eat out do you choose 
cheaper, less healthy options to cut costs? 

Having a machine learning recipe generator adapt to your preferences and practices offers the chance to develop better, more cost-effective ways of 
meeting your nutritional needs.
